The future of IRC bots is here! Xelhua gives to you, Auto 3.0, a new version of
the popular Auto IRC bot.

In this alpha5 release, we have added:

  qdb_search_resnum in the config.

Bug fixes:

We thank you for choosing Auto. Please remember that he is still in early
development stages. But we hope we've piqued your interest, as Auto's upcoming
module repository will allow modules to be created by anyone and uploaded
there for everyone to use.

Auto's goal is to create an efficient, stable and highly customizable IRC bot
in Perl. To offer an alternative to other platforms.

Enjoy Auto 3.0.0 Alpha 5!
