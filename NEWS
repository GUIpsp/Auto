          3.0


The future of IRC bots is here! Xelhua gives to you, Auto 3.0, a new version of
the popular Auto IRC bot.

In this alpha4 release, we have added:

* MySQL support.
* PostgreSQL support.
* A Greet module for greeting users on join.
* IRC logchan functionality.
* Improved multilingual support.

Bug fixes:

* Commands getting Permission denied even with incorrect prefix.

Incompatibilities:

* Database: Changed structure of the `qdb` table. Modify the configuration
  values in upgrade.pl then run it to upgrade the database.
* database:format is now required in the config.

We thank you for choosing Auto. Please remember that he is still in early
development stages. But we hope we've piqued your interest, as Auto's upcoming
module repository will allow modules to be created by anyone and uploaded
there for everyone to use.

Auto's goal is to create an efficient, stable and highly customizable IRC bot
in Perl. To offer an alternative to other platforms.

Enjoy Auto 3.0.0 Alpha 4!
