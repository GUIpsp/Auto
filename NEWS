We thank you for choosing Auto. Please remember that he is still in mid-
development stages. But we hope we've piqued your interest, as Auto's upcoming
module repository will allow modules to be created by anyone and uploaded
there for everyone to use.

Auto's goal is to create an efficient, stable and highly customizable IRC bot
in Perl. To offer an alternative to other platforms.

Enjoy Auto 3.0.0 Alpha 6!
