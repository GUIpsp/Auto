          3.0


The future of IRC bots is here! Xelhua gives to you, Auto 3.0, a new version of
the popular Auto IRC bot.

In this alpha7 release, we have added:

* Support for multiple configuration files using bin/auto -c=FILENAME. See
  bin/auto -h for details.
* Added network-wide user tracking through Core::IRC::Users.
* Added an Oper module.

Bug fixes:

* Fixed a bug where a CAP entry for a network was not recreated on a reconnect.
* Fixed a bug where incoming PART's from ourselves were not parsed.
* Fixed a bug in UNO where rehashing during a game caused a crash.
* Fixed a bug where appropriate data was not cleared after a disconnect.
* Fixed a bug where Vim modelines were in an incorrect spot in modules.

Incompatibilities:

* Many API changes - Minimum version bumped to 3.0.0a7.

We thank you for choosing Auto. Please remember that he is still in mid-
development stages. But we hope we've piqued your interest, as Auto's upcoming
module repository will allow modules to be created by anyone and uploaded
there for everyone to use.

Auto's goal is to create an efficient, stable and highly customizable IRC bot
in Perl. To offer an alternative to other platforms.

Enjoy Auto 3.0.0 Alpha 7!
