CAT <#channel> <main topic> <owner> <verb> <status> <other> <static> <divider>
    This is an advanced channel topic, the parameters
    pretty much describe themselves.
    [s] is parsed as a space.

CRT <#channel> <trigger> <response>
    This is a channel trigger. Everytime this trigger
    is sent in a PRIVMSG to the channel, the specified
    response will be PRIVMSG'd to the channel by the
    bot.
